# ALD - Atomic Layer Deposition
Deposition of Pt on silicon would be probably with ALD machine. 
According to [patent](https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/7a/07/89/83a1026ec14964/US5648297.pdf), we need to work on 111 silicon face, and deposited ~20nm of platinum (for the formation of PtSi).

# Trench Capacitors
I need to learn how trench capacitors are manufactured, especially:
- Deep RIE
- film deposition (probably ALD)

# Optimization of PtSi width
- how to do it? mostly find collaborations
